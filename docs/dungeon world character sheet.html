<h1 id="dungeon-world-character-sheet">Dungeon World Character Sheet</h1>
<p><a href="https://dungeon-world.com/"><u>Dungeon World</u></a> is a
popular Tabletop RPG (TTRPG) system that is built on top of the Powered
By the Apocalypse system. The game system is not as popular as other
games such as Dungeons and Dragons, but is similar in concept. There are
less rules to starting with Dungeon World which is what makes it a great
starting point for first time TTRPG players.</p>
<p>When I started playing in this space I noticed there was a lack of
digital tools for Dungeon World that allows players to get started in an
easy way. This is what drove me to build <a
href="https://dungeonworldcharacter.com/"><u>https://dungeonworldcharacter.com/</u></a>.
This is a digital character sheet that dynamically updates based on form
selection as the player selects values.</p>
<h1 id="technology-stack">Technology Stack</h1>
<p>Dungeon World Character Sheet is built on top of native JavaScript
features and Tailwind CSS. The UI is styled and built 100% from the
ground up and is specifically designed to look like the official Dungeon
World Character Sheet to ease players into using the new format. Dungeon
World Character Sheet uses a mix of the localStorage API and Progressive
Web Application features to allow it to work completely offline. You can
install the application by simply visiting the website and clicking the
install button in the URL bar of your favorite browser.</p>

<img src="images/dungeon-world-character-sheet/image2.png"
style="width:0.25in;height:0.20833in" /></p>
<p>The choice to make this application a Progressive Web Application
without a JavaScript framework was done intentionally to keep the
website accessible to as many people as possible. The goal of the
website was to allow anybody in the world to use it regardless of high
speed internet accessibility. In addition this bought me an incredibly
performant web application as well.</p>

<p><em>Figure 3: Showing I delivered a premium experience with very
little JavaScript.</em></p>
<p>As you can see in figure 3 I was able to deliver a premium Single
Page Application experience with very little JavaScript. This was
absolutely intentional and the goal from the start to keep load time
fast and bundle sizes small. Anyone anywhere in the world can enjoy this
website as long as they have JavaScript enabled and a modern web
browser.</p>
<p>One final note about the technology stack. While I didn’t use
component based frameworks like React, or Vue we absolutely did take
advantage of the built in Web Components technology that exist in modern
browsers. This allowed us to build using components without needing all
of the expensive overhead associated with all of the Modern JavaScript
frameworks. I think it shows that you don’t need a framework to build
highly complex applications on the web today.</p>
<p>The code is an open source project hosted on Github and it is
deployed via Netlify. The code is hosted here: <a

<h1 id="features">Features</h1>
<h2 id="dynamic-form">Dynamic Form</h2>
<p>The best feature added to Dungeon World Character Sheet is that the
form updates dynamically as you fill in information. Dungeon World has
some built in classes and we wanted to build in all of those skills and
class features. We also wanted to let players add their own custom
homebrew content as well. Let’s take a look at what the default form
looks like.</p>
<p><img src="images/dungeon-world-character-sheet/image7.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:4.06944in" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Empty Dungeon World Character Sheet Form</em></p>
<p>As you can see in figure 4 we give our players the option to fill in
whatever they want if they haven’t selected their class. This works
great for homebrew content.</p>
<p><img src="images/dungeon-world-character-sheet/image10.png"
style="width:1.39063in;height:2.70399in" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 5: Smart options</em></p>
<p>While we allow them to type whatever class they want in the field we
give them a smart list of options for the built in Dungeon World
classes. This system is used all throughout the character sheet.</p>
<p><img src="images/dungeon-world-character-sheet/image8.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:4.06944in" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 6: Once the class has been selected the form changes
substantially.</em></p>
<p>After a user selects a class the look, alignment, race, and move
section all update to allow the player to enter the officially defined
Dungeon World character sheet options. We also allow the user to always
enter their own custom information so that they can fully customize
their characters.</p>
<h2 id="list-inputs">List Inputs</h2>
<p>There are several inputs that allow a user to input information in a
list style format. An example of this is the Gear field</p>
<p><img src="images/dungeon-world-character-sheet/image6.png"
style="width:6.5in;height:1.55556in" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 7: Gear field.</em></p>
<p>As you enter an item in the field it expands and adds another field
to the form to allow the next item to be input. This feature allows the
form to dynamically adapt to the content the user is adding to keep the
character sheet the perfect size.</p>
<h2 id="caching-and-saving">Caching and Saving</h2>
<p>Caching the current character sheet and saving your character sheet
to a file is important to make sure that you don’t ever lose progress
when playing in a single Dungeon World campaign or many different
campaigns.</p>
<h3 id="cache">Cache</h3>
<p>The first feature we added in this regard was the cache. If the user
by chance refreshed the page or the browser crashed we did not want the
user to lose the progress. We accomplished this by updating the
localStorage cache every time a field was changed in the
application.</p>
<h3 id="saving-and-loading">Saving and Loading</h3>
<p><img src="images/dungeon-world-character-sheet/image3.png"
style="width:3.1875in;height:2.33333in" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 8: Saving and loading.</em></p>
<p>Saving and loading can be done from the side bar right next to the
character class. Saving will allow you to take a character sheet like
the one in figure 9 and get a JSON file that looks like this.</p>

<p>This file can then be selected via the load functionality when the
player is ready to resume the adventure with this character. It is an
easy way to allow players to manage many different characters.</p>
<h4 id="why-this-approach">Why this approach?</h4>
<p>I decided to go with using local files in order to save and load
characters vs using a server to allow the service to be free. Using a
server to host characters would incur an amount of cost that was not
0.</p>
<p>Additionally the file save and file load approach is a relatively
common thing most people have seen. Microsoft Word (offline not the web
app version) works this way and it seems to be a really good system that
people are familiar with.</p>
<h2 id="offline-support">Offline Support</h2>
<p>We briefly touched on this earlier but Dungeon World Character Sheet
is a Progressive Web Application that is installable. This means that
once the user visits the site and downloads the app they can use it
completely offline. They can save, load, create new, and update their
existing character sheets all offline. This has a major advantage since
players may not always have stable internet depending on where they live
or where they are playing in the world.</p>
<h1 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h1>
<p>After spending over a year building this application there are some
things I would change.</p>
<p>I believe that all applications should work without JavaScript, but
this application does not. Even though my goal was to allow anybody in
the world to use the application, some parts of the world don’t commonly
enable JavaScript. If you live in a location with incredibly slow
internet you likely have JavaScript disabled by default to prevent ads
from loading or slow JavaScript experiences. I would accomplish this by
using a server side language like PHP or Node to render the dynamic
forms. In addition I would progressively enhance the server side
rendered templates to still allow for all of the offline behavior to
work if JavaScript is enabled, but if it was not then rely on the server
side language to save and load the JSON files to populate the
information.</p>
<p>From a styling perspective I wouldn’t use Tailwind again. I really
like Tailwind and it has made a lot of large leaps forward in regards to
allowing developers to make really quick changes to CSS. Fundamentally
though I think it is a step in the wrong direction. I prefer CSS
frameworks like Picocss that work to make the native elements look a
specific way rather than relying on hundreds of custom classes. I
wouldn’t use Pico because it doesn’t fit the look and feel for this
project, but I’d likely try and restyle native elements to fit the
design I’ve created. I think this would yield less CSS and an even
better performance overall.</p>
